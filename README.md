# Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms on Cluster-Specific and Comprehensive Data in the Auto Insurance Industry
This repository contains the code, models, and methodology used in my MSc Data Analytics thesis at Lund University. The study explores how clustering techniques can improve machine learning model performance for predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) in the auto insurance industry.

### Objective of the study
To compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms on:
- The full dataset (comprehensive approach)
- Cluster-specific data (segmented approach using unsupervised learning)

The goal is to identify the most valuable customer clusters and build better retention strategies based on key CLV drivers.

### Key Concepts & Methods
- Customer Segmentation using:
    - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    - K-means Clustering

- CLV Prediction Models:
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - Neural Networks

- Model Evaluation:
  - R² Score
  - RMSE
  - Feature Importance
  - Hyperparameter Tuning

### Key Findings
- Random Forest showed the best overall performance.
- Predictive performance improved significantly when models were applied to clusters individually:
  - R² improved by 27%
  - RMSE reduced by 39%
